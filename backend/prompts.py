4. Return *only* valid JSON, with no extra text, markdown, code blocks, or comments. Example:
{{

    {{
      "career": "AI Product Managers",
      "fit_reason": "Your high openness and problem-solving skills align with leading AI-driven projects.",
      "ai_impact": "AI automates data analysis, but human vision is key.",
      "learning_path": "Learn product management, AI ethics, data literacy, leadership skills"
    }},
    {{...}},
    {{...}}
  ]
